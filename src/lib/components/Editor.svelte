		You really think you can fly that thing? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your
		dinosaur tour, right? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Is
		this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

	<p>
		They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Do you have any idea how
		long it takes those cups to decompose. What do they got in there? King Kong? Hey, you know how
		I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was part of something special. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Hey, you know how I'm,
		like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Just my luck, no ice. Jaguar shark! So
		tell me - does it really exist? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!
	</p>
	<p>
		So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady!
		Drive us out of here! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
		My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to
		cry about you little bastard!
	</p>
	<p>
		Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Life finds a way.
		So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Is this my
		espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
	</p>
	<p>
		Must go faster. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save
		the planet? Here's my chance. You really think you can fly that thing? Hey, take a look at the
		earthlings. Goodbye! Life finds a way. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get
		my espresso machine?
	</p>
	<p>
		Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! God creates
		dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. We
		gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause
		maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
	</p>
	<p>
		I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what
		is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Must go faster. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what
		is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Life finds a way. Hey, take a look at the earthlings.

		Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Checkmate... You really think
		you can fly that thing? Must go faster. I was part of something special. You know what? It is
		beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute
		the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want
		it anymore!
	</p>
	<p>
		Just my luck, no ice. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates
		don’t eat the tourists. What do they got in there? King Kong? Must go faster... go, go, go, go,
		go! Did he just throw my cat out of the window? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio,
		reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
